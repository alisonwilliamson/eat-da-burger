# Eat-Da-Burger

## Overview
* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* This app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

This is a burger logger created with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. It follows the MVC design pattern; and uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

After having trouble getting the devour button to work I got help from watching this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBePtS8q6IA&ab_channel=DaventertainmentInc.
